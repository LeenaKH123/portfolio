## Build a portfolio

Having a portfolio can make the difference and allows you to stand out. A majority of developers don't have a public presence with a portfolio and/or a blog. A prospective employer **will always** Google you, so you should own your brand name with your portfolio. Bonus point if you buy a domain and [set it up on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/). [set it up on Heroku](https://help.heroku.com/MTG1BIA7/how-do-i-connect-a-domain-to-my-heroku-app). We recommend GitHub Pages or Heroku as a porfolio should be a static website (you can use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) if you want a blogging section). Plus it's free, [even with SSL](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/).
